# Random sampling warm-up
# To begin, get some practice sampling categorical and normally-distributed data from a 
# population. Consult the “Simulate data” section of the “Plan” tab on the R tips 
# pages for help.


# 1. Sample 20 observations from a population having two groups of individuals, 
# “infected” and “uninfected”, in equal proportions. 
# Use a table to show the frequencies of the two categories obtained.

# 2. Repeat the previous step five times to convince yourself that the outcome 
# varies from sample to sample.

# 3. Sample 18 individuals from a population having two groups of individuals, 
# “mated” and “unmated”, where the proportion mated in the population is 0.7. 
# Summarise the frequencies in a table.

# 4. Repeat the previous step five times to convince yourself that the outcome 
# varies from sample to sample.

# 5. Sample 30 observations from a normally-distributed population having mean 0 
# and standard deviation 2. Plot the results in a histogram.

# 6. Repeat the following 5 times and calculate the mean each time: sample 30 
# observations from a normally-distributed population having mean 0 and standard 
# deviation 2. Convince yourself that the sample mean is different each time.
